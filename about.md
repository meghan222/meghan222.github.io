I am a 19 year old student living in Chicago and right in the thick of the life-stage where I must begin to shape the rest of my life. I spend my time reading about law and politics, juggling essays for class, and researching ways to improve my computational skills. My interest lies mainly in developing new ways to make communities more interconnected, and thus efficient. I think there is a huge gap of people needing more information on how to get their voice heard in local affairs. Town hall meetings, local elections, protests, are all ways people use their voice to effect change. It is my goal to make it easier for people to understand the inner workings of society and law so they can better navigate the world.
