# Summary
Bloc Jams is a gorgeously made platform that allows the User to easily navigate through albums and songs.
# Explanation
This project was my first, created with the Bloc program to assist in my learning of the facets of web development. My mentor, Carrie, was a great help to me in understanding the nuances of code and ways of simplifying it so it makes more sense and is more efficient.
# Problem
The user needs a web platform to play music on, we need to include several pages, graphics, and ingrained code behavior that changes based on circumstances. The problem lies in making all of this code work together, and not get tied up resulting in failure. There were issues during the entirety of the project, such as a page failing randomly due to a syntax error.
# Solution
The problems were incredibly frustrating, but with the help of the Internet and my trusty mentor Carrie, I was able to research and find new ways to better understand syntax and how code will execute.
# Result
 The result of the research is expanded wisdom on how to solve problems and which resources to use. This is invaluable and will help me for the rest of my life. I would do things differently if I were to start this project over. I would keep all of my code extremely organized, be on top of every git commit I made, and write out pseudocode so I could really understand each line of code. I will use this knowledge in the future so I can feel less lost while programming.
